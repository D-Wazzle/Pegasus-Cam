This is the main software package for Pegasus Cam, hosting the web interface on the RPi. The web interface has built-in motion detection, time lapse video, and video/image recording. This interface also allows for the video stream to be used in OpenCV for easy computer vision integration.

This software is largely developed by Silvan Melchoir and Bob Tidey, with contributions from other git users over the years. The original repository can be foundhere: https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface.git. Modifications were made for the Pegasus Cam for optimizing the latency and buffer of the video stream for real-time computer vision applications.
